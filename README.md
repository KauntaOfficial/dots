## Introduction
So unlike most people, I had just about the most unorthodox reason to switching to Linux. I loved the way it looked.
I barely did any research, just grabbed an .iso and wiped my hard drive free of Windows. 5 monthes later, no regrets. Ricing 
Linux has become one of my favorite pastimes and is a passion I'll continue to follow for a long time to come.

## Disclaimer
These dotfiles are to save **my setups.** Be warned, they probably won't work on your system without a bit of tinkering around.
I recommend just cherry picking what you need instead of copying my exact setup. 

## Dotfile Manager
Sponsored Message: I use my newly created dotfile manager, [Sequestrum](https://github.com/iiPlasma/sequestrum) to manage my
dotfiles. It's made specifically for managing dotfiles instead of something more general like Stow. It's got advanced features
like a universal config, one step complete install, automated command running, and makes your dotfiles a lot prettier than one
that use Stow! 

## Overview
- Window Manager: `openbox`
- Bar: `tint2`
- Compositor: `compton`
- Music Player: `mpd + ncmpcpp`
- Shell: `zsh`
- Terminal: `urxvt`
- Editor: `neovim`
- Web Browser: `firefox`

## Conclusion
I hope you found something you like here or got some inspiration for a new setup, after all, that's what dotfiles are for.... right? 
If you did like what you see, maybe got a bit of inspiration, or just straight up stole my setup, feel free to leave a star! Cheers!
