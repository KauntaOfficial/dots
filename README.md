## Disclaimer
These dotfiles are to save **my setups.** Be warned, they probably won't work on your system without a bit of tinkering around.
I recommend just cherry picking what you need instead of copying my exact setup. 

## Overview
- Window Manager: `openbox`
- Bar: `tint2`
- Compositor: `compton`
- Music Player: `mpd + ncmpcpp`
- Shell: `zsh`
- Terminal: `urxvt`
- Editor: `neovim`
- Web Browser: `firefox`

## Conclusion
I hope you found something you like here or got some inspiration for a new setup, after all, that's what dotfiles are for.... right? 
If you did like what you see, maybe got a bit of inspiration, or just straight up stole my setup, feel free to leave a star! Cheers!
